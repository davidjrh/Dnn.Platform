# Aperture
This is the new minimalist default theme for DNN 10.  This theme uses no CSS frameworks and has a small list of dependencies (e.g., TypeScript, SASS, Rollup).

Feel free to use this theme as a base for your theme development, but please be sure to copy it to a new custom directory.  Do not directly modify the DNN distributed Aperture theme files (in the Aperture skin/container directories).
